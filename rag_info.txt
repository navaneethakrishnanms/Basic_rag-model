"""
Retrieval-Augmented Generation, or RAG, is a technique for enhancing the accuracy
and reliability of large language models (LLMs) with facts fetched from external sources.
It grounds the model on the most accurate, up-to-date information and gives users
insight into the modelâ€™s sources. This ensures that the generated text is relevant,
accurate, and trustworthy. The process involves retrieving relevant information
from a knowledge base and providing it to the LLM as context.
